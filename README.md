<p align="center"> <img width="300" src="./images/presence.jpg"> </p>

Have you ever left a nerve-racking challenge and immediately wished for a do over? Maybe after a job interview, a performance, or a difficult conversation?

Too often we approach our lives' biggest hurdles with dread, execute them with anxiety, and leave them with regret.

## When: The Scientific Secrets of Perfect Timing

<p align="center"> <img width="300" src="./images/when.jpg"> </p>

Everyone knows that timing is everything. But we don't know much about timing itself. Our lives are a never-ending stream of "when" decisions: when to start a business, schedule a class, get serious about a person. Yet we make those decisions based on intuition and guesswork.

## The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life

<p align="center"> <img width="300" src="./images/fuck.jpg"> </p>

For decades, we’ve been told that positive thinking is the key to a happy, rich life. "Fuck positivity," Mark Manson says. "Let’s be honest, shit is fucked and we have to live with it." In his wildly popular Internet blog, Manson doesn’t sugarcoat or equivocate. He tells it like it is—a dose of raw, refreshing, honest truth that is sorely lacking today. The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is his antidote to the coddling, let’s-all-feel-good mindset that has infected American society and spoiled a generation, rewarding them with gold medals just for showing up.

You want fewer distractions and less on your plate. The daily barrage of e-mails, texts, tweets, messages, and meetings distract you and stress you out.
